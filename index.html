                        Richard Daniel "Rick" SanchezHe is a megagenius scientist whose alcoholism and reckless, nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his "daughter's" family, as well as the safety of their son, Morty. Upon the series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental health were large sources of speculation. As time has gone on, more has been revealed about his character, his backstory explaining much of his behaviour. At the same time, Rick has continuously committed more heinous acts, certifying him as the series' anti-hero, bordering on antagonist.

                     <p>
                         Throughout his numerous adventures with Morty, Rick has been shown to be ready and willing to disregard rules, laws and social norms if it is necessary to complete a task or escape a dangerous situation. Season one has Rick resorting to assault, battery, vandalism, smuggling, corruption of a minor, home invasion, reckless endangerment, terrorist threats, indecent exposure and even murder and arson in order to get the job done. The most common crimes committed are driving (or flying, in Rick's case) under the influence, drug abuse, and public intoxication.

                     <p>
                         While Rick's backstory remained shrouded in mystery for much of the series, it's clear that he always had a knack for science and invention, being able to rewire and fix a television around the age of 12. It wasn't until "Rickmurai Jack" where Rick's past is finally shown in great detail. The "totally fabricated" backstory shown in "The Rickshank Rickdemption" was mostly based on the truth and further hinted at in "Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort". Prior to the beginning of the series, Rick had a fairly normal middle-class childhood and had developed an interest in tinkering with things at a young age. As an adult, he married a woman named Diane and they had a daughter, Beth. Rick eventually became a scientist who was struggling to invent teleportation. One day, he was visited by an alternate version of himself, who offered him the ability to travel to different realities, but Rick refused. Angered by this, the other Rick sent a bomb through a portal, possibly attempting to kill Rick C-137, but instead killed Diane and Beth. Rick grieved for an unknown period of time, before inventing his own portal gun and going on a quest for revenge.
